Missing: Björn

**Suggested change in dealing with expenses for conferences**

The preferred way of doing this is to let Greenfield pay for the expenses. When the conference is over, split the cost by the number of Greenfield participants and invoice their respective companies.

**Suggested change to baseline sum: New sum is 2k according to the “Not Eminem”-theory.**

This should cover basic expenses AND the intent is to use it for marketing gifts. Specifically (but not limited to, easter and christmas gifts). We acknowledged that we haven’t done this before and that we’re not representing Greenfield in a good fashion.

**Stance on angel investing**

All participating partners agreed that acting as angel investors was of interest but a decision for the form was not agreed on. 

**Additional action points**

AP 1: Look into how we want to distribute the right to sign deals on behalf of Greenfield”

AP 2: Look into if swedish law requires the partnership agreement to contain a two-way exchange

AP 3: Create a github repo where we can do pull requests for the company manifesto.
